# Worldwide Energy Production and Consumption

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to show the switch to renewable energy by country and region over a 40 year period. 

## Questions to answer
How does GDP growth affect adoption of alternative energies?

How has energy consumption changed over time, and where are consumption trends headed?

Which countries are leading the switch to alternative energies and who are the newest changes?

## Results
There is definitely a correlation between GDP and growth and development of renewable energy production. We created two linear regression models, one for 2021 and one for 2011. The 2021 model had a higher accuracy score (70.6%) than the 2011 model (50.6%).

## Dashboards
We produced several dashboards for our differnt datasets for readiblity reasons. 
## Production 
        https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david.a.weissmann/viz/DUFinalProjectDavidW/Dashboard1?publish=yes
        It contains 2 charts the top shows who produced the most of a certain type of energy in 2021 and can be filtered based off the type of energy being produced. I           was suprised at how dominant the Chinese were in the Renewable energy sphere. The other is a breakdown of the different types of energy each country produces             over a series of years, and can be filtered based on the Country.
      
## GDP

        This shows a breakdown of the change in GDP over time as well as the GDP of some of the smaller countries. It's interesting to see the rise of China in these             charts.
        
## Consumption
         https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/matt.roberts6826/viz/GDP_16805755653810/Dashboard2
         This shows the change in consumption over 4 decades for the largest consumers, the US, China, the Russian Federation, and The U.S.S.R.
